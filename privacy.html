We may also retain log files for analysis purposes – these log files are generally retained for a short period of time, except in cases where the information is used for website security, improving the website functionality, and in the cases in which we are legally obligated to retain information for longer time periods.</p>

         <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

         <p>At the end of an agreed retention period your information will either be securely and confidentially destroyed or anonymized. Anonymization is the process of either encrypting or removing personal information from data sets, so that it is not possible to identify individuals from the data.</p>

In addition, we may retain data even if you withdraw your consent, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data.</p>
        
         <br>  


         <h4>13. Legal basis for processing your personal information</h4>

          • Where we process your personal information for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party). 
          <br><br>
