         <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>

         <p>Whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes.</p>

         <p>If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or emailing us at tailormadewebsites@mail.com.</p>

         <p>We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.</p>

       <h4>10. Removing your information</h4>

         <p>At any point, you may delete your account, however as this is potentially very destructive (removing license authorisations for any sites you hold) we ask that you contact us if you wish to request this. We will also remove data linked to you stored with our third parties.</p>            
        <br>




         <h4>11. How long do we hold your information for?</h4>

         <p>We will only hold your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. We may also retain log files for analysis purposes – these log files are generally retained for a short period of time, except in cases where the information is used for website security, improving the website functionality, and in the cases in which we are legally obligated to retain information for longer time periods.</p>

         <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

         <p>At the end of an agreed retention period your information will either be securely and confidentially destroyed or anonymized. Anonymization is the process of either encrypting or removing personal information from data sets, so that it is not possible to identify individuals from the data.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h4>12. Your Rights</h4>

        <p>You have the right to:</p>

          <p>The exceptions to these rights include: When access to personal data would reveal personal information about another individual, or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. In addition, we may retain data even if you withdraw your consent, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data.</p>
        
         <br>  


         <h4>13. Legal basis for processing your personal information</h4>

          • Where we process your personal information for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party). 
          <br><br>
          • Where the processing of personal information is necessary to perform a contract with you (for example, where you have purchased a product or service from us).
          <br><br>
          • Where the processing of personal information is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation that applies to us.
