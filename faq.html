        <h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>I run a small- or medium-sized business and want an online presence to promote my business. What's the first step?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>You need a domain name, a Hosting server and a professionally developed website. </p>

         <p>You also need the website to be uploaded to your host and promoted to search engines. We can help you with all aspects of getting a website up and running.</p>

            

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Do we need to have a face to face meeting to discuss the website design? Does the meeting have to take place in person?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Most of the time, a meeting isn't necessary and the work can be completed with only discussions over the phone and email. We upload our work to private websites that only clients can access. We then work with you to discuss the site and review changes. The site isn't made available to the public until it looks and works exactly as you wish.</p>

        <p>Face to face meetings in person are not necessary as we are able to conduct all meetings via video calls. This allows us to work with clients anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>Please note however that due to the current UK guidelines, meeting in person is not available at the moment but this is under constant review. All initial meetings are being undertaken through video call and telephone.</p>

        <br
        <br>
        <h4>How long will it take for my website to be designed?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The time it takes to build a site depends on the complexity of that site and also our current workload.</p>

        <p>If you have a deadline, we will work hard to meet it. Once we know exactly what you require, we can give you a specific timeframe.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>What type of coding software do you use?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>We use a combination of features such as XHTML, CSS, PHP and Python. We also use software such as Wix and WordPress.</p>

        <p>How we build your website is dependent on the clients current specifications and what they want to do with the site in the future.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>What is Wix and WordPress?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Wix and WordPress are free platforms on which website designers and developers like us build websites. It provides all the flexibility and functionality we need so you’re easily able to keep your site up to date with new content. We use it for all the different websites we create, from small business websites to ecommerce sites.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>If Wix and WordPress are free, why do I pay for your services?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Wix and WordPress are free to use. We charge you for design and development services but once your site is finished, you don’t have to pay any ongoing costs for using the platforms itself.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>What is web hosting?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Web Hosting is the space that you ‘rent’ which houses your web files and allows users to access your site and the information contained on it. Web hosting is required in order to get your website online.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Do you provide Domain and Hosting service?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>No, we do not currently provide this service and therefore you must register your own domain name and provide us with your hosting server. </p>
        <p>Once you’ve sorted your domain out and hosting server, we can take things from there.</p>
        <p>Without your chosen hosting server, we will not be able to upload your website. </p>
        <p>Should you need advice on this we can help you.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Do you offer ongoing help with our new site once it's launched?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Yes, We offer a full range of support options to all of our clients, from basic help and setup needs to full web management solutions. We are a small company who strive to meet our clients’ needs no matter what they may be.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Can I contact you after hours?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>All of our systems are constantly monitored.</p>
        <p>Although you won't be able to speak to us after hours, you can leave a voicemail or drop us an email which will be picked up if it is urgent.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Who owns the website once design work is complete?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The website belongs to you. Once the site is complete and signed off, you will receive a copy. If you wish to work with another Web developer, you can provide them with the copy for them to use.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Do you redesign existing websites?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Yes we do!  We provide all clients with a free website evaluation.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>How much will a website cost me and are there any hidden costs?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The cost of a website varies as it depends on its complexity. We are happy to discuss your requirements and provide a quote at any time.</p>
        <p>Once we have provided you with an estimate, we will adhere to our quoted price and will not provide you with any additional costs.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>What are the payment terms for the design and development of my website?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>We like to work on a 30% upfront basis with 30% payable after the designs are agreed and the outstanding 40% payable when the development has been completed and signed off.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>How do I get my website on search engines, especially Google?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Modern search engines will find your site naturally, through links to your site from other sites. Google especially relies on your incoming links to determine popularity and relevance. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>How long does it take to see results from SEO?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Google say that in most cases SEO can take between 4 months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefit.</p>
